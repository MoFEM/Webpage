<div class="textblock"><p>The catalyst for the creation of <a class="el" href="namespaceMoFEM.html" title="implementation of Data Operators for Forces and Sources">MoFEM</a> was the need for a flexible and numerically accurate modelling environment for multi-physics problems posed by our partners, including industry (EDF Energy, Jacobs, Advanced Forming Research Centre (University of Strathclyde), Rolls-Royce, etc).</p>
<p><a class="el" href="namespaceMoFEM.html" title="implementation of Data Operators for Forces and Sources">MoFEM</a> delivers a software development platform which enhances scientific innovation by providing a flexible and adaptable modelling framework, using novel disruptive approaches to long-standing problems in continuum mechanics and tackling conflicting requirements of accuracy and computational efficiency. This is achieved in <a class="el" href="namespaceMoFEM.html" title="implementation of Data Operators for Forces and Sources">MoFEM</a> by developing and adopting state-of-the-art FE technologies, for example: \(H^1\)-, \(H(\text{curl})\)-, \(H(\text{div}\))- and \(L^2\)-conforming finite elements equipped with hierarchical, heterogeneous and anisotropic approximation bases; error-driven hp-adaptivity; mesh topology evolution. In addition, MoFEM’s HPC capabilities are supported by its unique data structures that are capable of handling generic multi-field, multi-physics, multi-scale problems and building tailored composite solvers.</p>
<p>Therefore, <a class="el" href="namespaceMoFEM.html" title="implementation of Data Operators for Forces and Sources">MoFEM</a> provides users with an effective tool for solving Partial Differential Equations arising in various fields of Engineering and Applied Physics: solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, soft matter physics, heat transfer, electromagnetism, etc. Furthermore, <a class="el" href="namespaceMoFEM.html" title="implementation of Data Operators for Forces and Sources">MoFEM</a> features an extendable modular design: while its open-source core library is developed to manage the complexities of FEM, additional user modules are devoted to particular applications. Such a toolkit-like structure allows for independent development of modules with different repositories, owners and licenses.</p>

Brittle crack propagation under contact loading</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify"> We present the first implicit computational framework for simulating crack propagation along contact interfaces and surfaces under load in three-dimensional bodies. We restrict ourselves to brittle fracture and frictionless contact and focus on numerical challenges associated with the coupling of unilateral constraints emerging from the Griffith's criterion and the contact conditions. The formulation is based on the configurational mechanics framework and is solved using the finite element method. The approach utilises a monolithic Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation permitting simultaneous resolution of crack propagation and unilateral contact constraints. Contact is embedded in the model using the well-known mortar contact formulation. Evolving cracks are explicitly modelled as displacement discontinuities within the mesh. Heterogeneous approximation of arbitrary order is used to discretise spatial displacements, enabling \(hp\)-adaptive refinement around the crack front and the contact interfaces traversed by the crack. The result is a holistic approach which handles issues associated with thermodynamic consistency, numerical accuracy and robustness of the computational scheme. Several numerical examples are presented to verify the model formulation and implementation; they also highlight how contact pressure and load applied on surfaces traversed by cracks influence their propagation. The robustness of the approach is validated by comparison of our simulations with industrial experiment involving cracks of complex morphologies propagating along contact interfaces between multiple deformable bodies <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_athanasiadis2023computational">[8]</a>. </div><p><br  />

<div style="text-align: justify"> Mechanobiology is an emerging multidisciplinary field at the crossroads of medicine, biology, physics and engineering. It focusses on how physical forces drive pathophysiological processes from the cell to the tissue level scale <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_krieg2019atomic">[42]</a>. A key role in understanding of these processes is attributed to mechanical properties of cells. The state-of-the-art approach for identification of elastic properties of cells is based on nanoindentation experiments exploiting atomic force microscopy (AFM). While these experiments provide wealth of information on the elastic response of cells, the current analysis is often limited to fitting using analytical contact mechanics models based on the assumption that cells can be treated as homogeneous isotropic linear elastic solids. However, much more can be learned from single cell nanoindentation by augmenting experimental procedures with numerical simulation, for example, by using the finite-element method considering heterogeneous solids and nonlinear behaviours. Our objective is to provide an increase in the detail and reliability of extracted mechanical data from AFM experiments by developing an experimentally-informed numerical model of the nanoindentation process. We consider hyperelastic and viscoelastic materials undergoing large deformations, while the contact interaction is handled by consistent and stable numerical algorithms. This permits to extract mechanical properties of cells from experimental data with high precision, setting a new standard in the analysis of nanoindentation curves. </div><p><br  />

<div style="text-align: justify"> The development of a massively parallel multifield plasticity formulation for finite strain plasticity <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Lewandowski2023">[45]</a> is motivated by the inability of classical computational plasticity to fully exploit modern scientific computing, due to internal variables, problematic in case of advection in an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation. To avoid the local integration of the elastoplastic material model, the balance of linear momentum, the flow relation, and the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker constraints are collectively cast in a variational format.</div><div style="text-align: justify">An additive kinematic split, proposed by Miehe et al <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Miehe_Karol">[54]</a>, facilitates the expression of finite strain models in a classical small strain setting by introducing a logarithmic strain measure. The measures of plastic deformation are directly approximated using finite element basis functions in \(L^2\) space. The ensuing proliferation of global degrees of freedom is addressed by exploiting the block sparse structure of the algebraic system together with a tailored efficient and scalable block matrix solver which can utilise emerging hardware architectures.</div><div style="text-align: justify">The problem is solved implicitly on a global level with a monolithic Newton-Raphson scheme.

A mixed Finite Element method for 3D elasticity problems at large strains with weakly imposed symmetry</h2>

<p>\(^1 \textit{Glasgow Computational Engineering Centre, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow}\)</p>
<div style="text-align: justify"> We show an extension of the mixed finite element for small strain elasticity to large strain problems. This work develops finite element formulation, where are independently approximated four fields, i.e. stresses, logarithm stretches, rotations vector, and displacements. Each field is associated with sets of equations, i.e. conservation of linear momentum, conservation of angular momentum, constitutive equation, and consistency equation between displacements and deformation. The connection between rotations vector and rotation tensor is established by exponential map. The stresses are approximate in \(H(\text{div})\) space, and remaining three fields in \(L^2\) space. Such formulation creates a very sparse system of equations, easy to parallelise, enabling highly-scalable and robust solvers. The finite element is implemented in open-source software, MoFEM <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Lukasz_MOFEM">[39]</a>, developed at the Glasgow Computational Engineering Centre. This novel finite element technology enables us to tackle problems nearly incompressible soft materials. Also, finite element mixed-formulation opens new possibilities to tackle robust problems in DD-driven approaches for large strains and multi-field formulations for computational plasticity and efficient error estimators for \(p\)-adaptivity.</div><p> <br  />

<div style="text-align: justify"> This work focuses on 3D modelling of contact between rigid and elasto-plastic bodies within the Finite Element (FE) framework using the Lagrange Multipliers (LM) approach to fulfill Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The dual base proposed in <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Wohlmuth2004">[33]</a> and successfully used for large strains <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_DualMortar2DPop">[57]</a> to approximate the LM field is in the appropriate energy space \(H^{-1/2}\) and can be explicitly used for \(h\)-refinement. However, for \(p\)-refinement a new approach must be proposed to take advantage of inherent benefits of heterogeneous basis functions such as compatibility with optimal multi-grid solvers. We present a novel approach for modelling contact problems, where the discrete functional space for LM defined on contact surfaces emerges from the trace of Raviart-Thomas space defined inside the domain. This approach enables to evaluate terms present in contact formulation both on the boundary and within the volume via Gauss theorem, providing stability to the discrete solution. Furthermore, it allows for higher-order approximation, permitting to combine \(h\)-refinement with \(p\)-refinement. The framework was successfully used for modelling Incremental Cold Flow Forming (ICFF) and flat tyre rolling on a rigid flat surface. The framework will be extended to model contact between two flexible bodies for elastic and crack propagation conditions. </div><div align="center"> <img src="flat_tire_mix.png" alt="Description of your image" width="65%" class="inline"/> </div><div align="center"><b>Figure: Examples of implementation of the proposed contact model for arbitrary orders of approximation: (a) ICFF and (b) flat tire</b></div><div align="center"> </div><hr  />

An industry driven approach to numerical modelling of the Incremental Cold Flow Forming process</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify"> In the last two decades, incremental cold flow forming (ICFF) has progressively advanced as a metal forming process. The design of this process is inherently difficult and still poorly understood, due to complex underlying physical phenomena involving hollow cylindrical geometry, undergoing fast rotational rigid body contact loading, resulting in large plastic deformations. Commercially available finite element packages are currently providing unreliable and computationally expensive solutions in an attempt to understand the process. To address these challenges, a multifield approach to plasticity was developed in MoFEM by the co-authors <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Lewandowski2023">[45]</a>. This approach is highly flexible, allowing for straightforward coupling with other physical phenomena including contact mechanics and advection of the plastic variables as part of an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation improving the overall robustness of the numerical scheme for modelling ICFF.</div><div style="text-align: justify">Furthermore, to aid engineers in understanding the manufacturing process, the ability to modify and adjust the rigid indenter geometry and movement paths easily are a top priority to investigate different process setups quickly and efficiently, such as those shown in the following Figure. Therefore a simple python interface was developed in MoFEM to allow any user to easily implement custom rigid body geometry or a movement path through a signed distance function (SDF). A SDF is used to define the location of a surface and when provided a set of coordinates it returns either a positive value (gap) to the rigid surface, a negative value (penetration) or zero when on the surface itself. This can easily be adopted into any contact formulation in order to resolve the classical KKT contact conditions. </div><div align="center"> <img src="iccf_flow_forming.jpg" alt="Description of your image" width="65%" class="inline"/> </div><div align="center"><b>Figure: Contact of rigid rollers with rotating elasto-plastic workpiece</b></div><div align="center"> </div><hr  />

<div style="text-align: justify"> A new class of implicit-explicit methods combined with a p-adaptive mixed finite element formulation is proposed to simulate the diffusion of reacting species in MoFEM. Hierarchical polynomial functions are used to construct a conforming base for the flux vectors, and a non-conforming base for the mass concentration of the species. The mixed formulation captures the distinct nonlinearities associated with the flux constitutive equations and the reaction terms. The IMEX method conveniently treats these two sources of nonlinearity implicitly and explicitly, respectively, within a single time-stepping framework. A reliable a posteriori error estimate is proposed and analysed. A p-adaptive algorithm based on the proposed a posteriori error estimate is also constructed. The combination of the p-adaptive mixed formulation and the IMEX method delivers a robust and efficient algorithm. The proposed methods eliminate the coupled effect of mesh size and time step duration on the algorithmic stability. A residual-based a posteriori error estimate is derived, and when combined with the hierarchical finite element spaces allow for the formulation of an efficient p-adaptive algorithm <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_wakeni2021p">[76]</a> .

<div style="text-align: justify"> The standard approach to mechanical problems requires the solution to the mathematical equations that describe both the conservation laws and the constitutive relationships, where the latter are obtained after fitting experimental data to a certain material model. Such models range from simple linear constitutive relationships with just one constant (e.g. Darcy's law for saturated flow) to more complex ones, such as unsaturated flow, hyperelasticity, brittle fracture of heterogeneous materials, requiring fitting of multiple parameters.</div><div style="text-align: justify">In this work, we follow the data-driven (DD) approach <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_kirchdoerfer_data-driven_2016">[40]</a> as an alternative to material modeling, and develop a DD finite element framework for nonlinear diffusion problems, such as heat transfer in porous media. In particular, we consider nuclear graphite which has nonlinear dependence of the heat flux on temperature and its gradient resulting from the irradiated graphite microstructure.

<div style="text-align: justify"> A finite element model is presented for the prediction of macrosegregation in binary alloys for both 2D and 3D problems utilising a monolithic solution scheme. In this work we present simulations of Pb-18wt% Sn and Sn-5wt% Pb binary alloys assuming columnar solidification with the Lever rule assumption at the microscopic scale. For solving Navier-Stokes equations, we chose the Taylor-Hood (TH) element, where both velocity and pressure fields are sought in the \(H^1\) energy space. The model implementation allows for the arbitrary choice of order of approximation, \(p\), for the various approximated fields which allows for \(\mbox{$p$-refinement}\). TH element is chosen since it is known to theoretically exhibit an optimal convergence rate. Other assumptions for the macrosegregation model include: incompressible flow and newtonian fluid; Boussinesq approximation to account for thermo-solutal buoyancy; thermodynamic equilibrium and perfect solute diffusion in both liquid and solid phases. The monolithic scheme proposed encompasses a full coupling between the conservation equations. Results obtained show good agreement with other columnar solidification models <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_bellet2009call">[12]</a>, <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_chen2020finite">[18]</a> and <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_combeau2012analysis">[21]</a>.

Scenario B demonstrated complex, uneven distribution of surface pressure on the DMEK graft during uncontrolled bubble release. Uneven pressure concentration can cause local tissue warping, with air/fluid displacement via capillary waves generated on the fluid-air interface adversely impacting DMEK support. We have quantitatively and qualitatively modelled the forces involved in DMEK adherence in normal circumstances. We have shown releasing air/gas can abruptly reduce DMEK tissue support via generation of large pressure gradients at the liquid/bubble/graft interfaces, creating negative local forces. Surgeons should consider these principles to reduce DMEK graft dislocation rates via optimised bubble size to graft size, longer acting bubble support and avoiding rapid decompression. </div><p><br  />

<div style="text-align: justify"> The physical response of piezoelectric materials is governed by the strong coupling of mechanical and electrical phenomena as their mechanical deformation generates electric potential gradients and vice versa. There has been an increasing interest in these materials due to the breadth of engineering applications where they have been successfully used, such as power harvesting and smart sensing <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_COCHRAN20123">[19]</a>, <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_piezo_electrics_2021">[52]</a>. Therefore, the accurate determination of piezoelectric materials' parameters is essential which has lead to an increasing demand for improved numerical tools to support this scope. In this work, we propose a coupled numerical framework for piezoelectric material characterisation. For our analysis, experimentally obtained electric impedance phase diagrams are used, where a cubic specimen is subjected to a voltage pulse that generates its mechanical and voltage damping oscillation in the figure. Thereafter, the experimentally obtained resonance frequencies and their amplitude are used to determine a set of objective functions that are minimised via the Finite Element Model Updating method (FEMU) in order to find the material parameters. The minimisation procedure involves a series of fully implicit dynamic FEM analyses with changing the material input parameters between simulations. The proposed framework is aimed to aid new piezoelectric material technologies where more complex structures are involved and to be extended to account for more physical phenomena. </div><p><br  />

<div style="text-align: justify"> Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a cutting-edge energy harvester that transforms mechanical excitation to electric energy during contact electrification and electrostatic induction. Prior research which studied the electrostatic characteristics of TENG performance mostly relied on approximate analytical models. However, an accurate numerical model is crucial for understanding the relation between the output performance and various geometric and material parameters of the device. This study aims to develop a detailed finite element model to predict the TENG behaviour at different configurations. The investigation underlines the generation of the open circuit voltage, \(V_{oc}\) due to the surface charges at the interface between dissimilar tribo-layers of the contact-separation model of TENG. A series of simulations were conducted to anticipate \(V_{oc}\) at different air gaps between the layers. The results in figure shows the comparison between FEM results and approximate analytical solutions. The numerical solution conforms to analytical for the small gaps, while for the larger gaps, it converges with the approximations. We anticipate gaining a deeper understanding of the performance characteristics through the FE model and corresponding quantitative analysis. Furthermore, we aim to develop a multi-physical FE framework encompassing contact mechanics, electrostatics and electric circuit equations, to facilitate the optimization and design of TENGs. </div><p><br  />
